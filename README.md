# BMK Keyboard Firmware

## description

Hi there.  This is the firmware repository for keyboards produced by Brad Arnett (bradmakeskeyboards.com).

## how do I use this?

Just copy the qmk_firmware/keyboards directory into your existing qmk_firmware directory.  At that point any of the files should be accessible by qmk.

Similarly, if you are using VIAL instead, copy vial-qmk/keyboards into your existing vial-qmk directory.

## why don't you just PR this into the real repositories?

I will definitely do that with QMK and Vial at some point in the future.  At the current moment all of the boards are either prototypes or very small batch test runs given out to a handful of people.  Until there is a wider audience I want to address, I don't want to contribute to the clutter already building on either of those repositories.

## do it now

No.

## I have problems!

Okay.  If they're related to the firmware, contact me at brad.arnett@gmail.com or log a bug on the github page.
